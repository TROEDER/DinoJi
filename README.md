A friend of mine is absolutely believing in success of a specific app idea (out of his mind). Unfortunately it's top secret. Therefore i can not add any more description..

# <button>Import and Things</button> 

<a id="donate" name="donate" href="#donate" style="background-color: green; font-weight: 700; color: #fff;" onclick="javascript:alert('Gone sailing around the world on my new sailing yacht xD Thank you all who made this possible!') ;">Donate!</a> :+1:
You can donate, but its maybe a waste. We no nice guys. Though we're too weak to be bad guys.
